Pythonic interface to the auo-generated aravis bindings.

Minimal example code:

import aravis
ids = aravis.get_device_ids() #List visible cameras
cam = aravis.Camera(ids[0]) #get the first camera
try:
    cam.start_acquisition_continuous(nb_buffers=2)
    frame = cam.pop_frame()# get next frame from camera
    print("Saving frame to ", "myframe.npy")
    np.save(path, frame)
    cam.stop_acquisition()
finally:
    cam.shutdown()

Next read the other examples and the code

Rmq: Aravis needs to be compiled with intropsection support.
It requires at least libgirepository1.0-dev and gobject-introspection packges on ubuntu

User may need to increase max UDP packet size:
ifconfig etho0 mtu 9000 up
or/and
vi /etc/network/interfaces
add mtu 9000
